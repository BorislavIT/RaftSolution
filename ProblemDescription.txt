George is out with his goats at the shore. He wants to get them through the shore, making not more than K courses with a raft with a particular capacity.
The goats aren't the same - some of them are small, others are large and third are ill. George wants to find out what's the minimum raft
capacity which would allow him to get all of his N goats to the other side with not more than K courses.

The order of which goats go through first matters.
The strategy is the following:
Every course he puts the largest goat, which fits, after that the second largest, which fits together with the 
first, then the next, which fits with the first two. After no other goat can fit, he takes them to the other side
he comes back and uses the same procedure for the others. If after K courses there are goats to be taken to the other side
that means that the capacity isn't enough. From the strategy stated above, the capacity needs to be at least the size
of the biggest goat. Help George!

Input

First row
N and K - amount of goats and maximum amount of courses.

Second row
A1, A2, ..., AN - weight of the goats -> INTEGERS

Output
One INTEGER - minimum capacity of the raft, which would allow all of the goats to pass with courses < K, using george's strategy.

Limitations:

1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ K ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 100000
